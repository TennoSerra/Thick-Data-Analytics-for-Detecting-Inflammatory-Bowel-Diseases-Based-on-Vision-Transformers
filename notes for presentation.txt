Siamese Masked nn explanation image.
First use random data augmentations to generate two views of an image,
referred to as the anchor view and the target view. Subsequently, a random mask is applied to the anchor view,
while the target view is left unchanged. The objective is then to assign the representation of the masked anchor
view to the same clusters as the representation of the unmasked target view. A standard cross-entropy loss is
used as the criterion to optimize.
